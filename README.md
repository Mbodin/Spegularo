Spegularo
=========

Imagine a medieval world in which magic consists of… JavaScript.  A world in which magic consists of changing the code of the universe without end.

Spegularo is meant to be a rogue-like game in which you’ll change your own code to get to accomplish your destiny.
In contrary to Untrusted (http://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/), Spegularo won’t make you restart your level:  you’ll change the code in a… hard way!

By the way, Spegularo is an Esperanto name and means “set of mirrors”.
